                            <br>
                            <p>Hi there! My name is Adam Ferguson, and I'm an aspiring music producer with a deep passion for creating soundscapes that evoke mood and emotion.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I grew up in a musical family, and that love for music has always been a part of who I am. Over the years, I've explored music production through a variety of platforms — from GarageBand and Ableton to phone apps and more. A lot of my early experiments sounded like a chaotic blend of noises, but I was always fascinated by the process and the possibilities. Recently, I’ve begun to take production more seriously and have fallen in love with FL Studio. I’ve been exploring how different layers of sound interact, how they fill out the space, and how frequency, texture, and rhythm work together to shape a track’s emotional impact.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>For me, music is both a form of self-expression and a creative outlet. I love experimenting with new sounds and genres, and I’ve always been someone who listens to a bit of everything. Each track I work on is an opportunity to challenge myself, grow, and refine my skills.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I’d really appreciate any support or feedback on my work, which you can find <a href="projects.html" style="color: blue">here</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Bio</h3>
                        <p>My name is Adam Ferguson. I am a self-taught freelance web developer currently volunteering
                            at Mandalay
                            Wellbeing CIC where I maintain and develop their many websites such as <a
                                href="https://www.wolhss.co.uk" target="_blank">wolhss.co.uk</a>. I have strong
                            knowledge of both
                            HTML5
                            and CSS3 as well as experience and an understanding of both Bootstrap 4 and Sass. I am very
                            adaptive and eager to learn; striving to expand upon my skills every day. One of the ways
                            in which I accomplish this is by completing
                            various courses on Udemy, you can <a href="projects.html#projects-certificates"> View

                            passionate about creating new and challenging projects that push the boundaries of what I
                            know, allowing me to build upon and gain a more thorough understanding of my skills.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I completed my secondary school education with 10 GCSEs A-C, including both Maths and
                            English; I went on to study BTEC Level 3 Subsidiary Diploma (programming) at college in
                            which I received a distinction*; this is where I discovered my love for coding. I have
                            always enjoyed pushing boundaries and believe 'variety is the spice of life'.
